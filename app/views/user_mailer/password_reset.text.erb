Dear <%= @company %>,

This link will expire within 120 minutes (2 hours). If you do not wish to reset
your password, simply ignore this email and nothing will be changed.

Please Note: Resetting your Kungiya password will also change
the password for FTP programs such as FrontPage, DreamWeaver,
Expression Web (or any other site authoring tool). You will need to
update your password in each application in order to connect.
